        Hmm, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
        I will find the time, we will find the timing
        'Cause you are on my mind, I hope that you don't mind it
        You know that I want you, you know that I want you next to me
        But if you need some space, I will step away
        And I know it might sound stupid but for me, yeah
        I just gotta keep believing and I've heard
        Some say you will love me one day
        And I will wait, I will wait to get your loving one day
        Just say you will love me one day
        And I will wait, I will wait to get your loving one day
        I promise that I'll try, that I will try to meet someone
        And there's so many guys, who told me I deserve someone
        I wanna call you up but maybe it will only make it worse
        I guess that I just don't know what to do with myself
